<p>To use these templates, you'll have to update the "IK Player Template" after importing the templates.</p>
<p>Or, with 0.1.6 you can import and execute the macro in IK-Macros to update the player template for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>New update macro with 0.1.13!</p>
<p>!!!Do make a backup, before running the macro! There is a possibility of it deleting details from actors. I tried my best, so that that won't happen, but it happend to me a few times in development of the macro!!!</p>
<p>Just delete the previously imported templates, re-import them from the compendium, import the macro from the compendium and run it.</p>
